# ðŸ“„ Individual exercises

This GitHub repository gathers some individual exercises made during learning weeks at Ada Tech School. 

The instructions of these exercises are made by the Ada team and are by consequence internal to the school. 

> *Not all of them are complete yet, but all of them have been tried and worked on*

We had one week to complete each exercise, in parallel with the lessons and exercises associated to the lessons which explains the fact that they are not all finished or cleaned.
